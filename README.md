# Huddle landing page with single introductory section

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

In this project I have built this **landing page**.

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
